description: Code clarity becomes crucial as AI assistance grows. A practical
  perspective on choosing technologies for the future of development, focusing
  on EdgeDB and TypeScript as examples of readable, maintainable code.
---
In an era where code generation through AI is becoming the norm, our criteria for selecting technologies need to evolve. It's no longer just about developer productivity – it's about code clarity and maintainability.

Take database technologies for example. While Drizzle offers compelling features, EdgeDB's declarative schema approach produces more readable and maintainable code. This becomes crucial when collaborating with AI tools and reviewing generated code.

The same principle applies to language choices. JavaScript might offer quick development cycles, but TypeScript's static typing provides an invaluable safety net for AI-generated code. It's like having a second pair of eyes validating your prompts' output.

As we navigate this new landscape, prioritizing readability and type safety isn't just about clean code – it's about building a sustainable foundation for human-AI collaboration in software development.
