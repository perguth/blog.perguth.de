Just discovered this interesting open-source project that caught my eye. Colanode combines Slack-style chat with Notion-like documentation in a local-first architecture. What makes it stand out:

✨ Key highlights:

\- Built on CRDTs (using Yjs) for real-time collaboration  
\- Local SQLite first, then sync to server - meaning true offline support  
\- Self-hostable with Docker (needs Postgres + Redis + S3)  
\- Built-in AI assistant for productivity

For senior engineers looking at collaboration tools: The architecture choices are solid - they're prioritizing data ownership and offline capabilities while maintaining real-time collaboration. Currently in beta, with free cloud options in both EU and US.
