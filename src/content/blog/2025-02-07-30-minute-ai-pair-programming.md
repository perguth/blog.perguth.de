description: Clean timezone dashboard for new Chrome tabs. System-wide dark
  mode, interactive progress tracking, zero dependencies.
---
Just wrapped an enlightening development sprint with Claude AI. In 30 minutes, we:

\- Scaffolded a minimal Chrome extension  
\- Built a clean timezone dashboard  
\- Pivoted from popup to new tab design  
\- Added dark mode + interactive timezone focusing  
\- Generated icons, documentation, and repo setup

𝗜𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁: The only time the AI steered us in a complex direction was suggesting extra security headers - which we quickly identified and dropped for a cleaner solution. Otherwise, it was like pairing with a pragmatic senior dev focused on shipping clean, minimal code.

See the result: [github.com/thingylabs/chrome-new-tab-timezones](http://github.com/thingylabs/chrome-new-tab-timezones)

𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸: Vanilla JS, no runtime dependencies, system-wide dark mode, responsive design

For tech leaders: This showcases how AI pairing can accelerate development while maintaining code quality - and how human oversight keeps solutions pragmatic.
