When we talk about servers, we often think of central data centers supporting cloud services or local servers operated by companies.

However, that doesn’t have to be the case anymore. For years, static content has been delivered by CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) worldwide, close to users. Now, the same is starting to happen for dynamic web applications.

When we talk about “the Edge,” it means that your website or application is hosted simultaneously on multiple servers around the globe, always close to a user. These distributed servers can not only serve static content but also run custom code that powers a dynamic web application.

The benefit of edge deployment lies in reducing latency. When the application is delivered from an edge server near the user, all users benefit from faster loading times.

The bounce rate of a website is heavily influenced by its loading time. According to an analysis¹, the following patterns emerge:

\=> At 2 seconds loading time:  
\==> 9% of visitors leave the site.

\=> At 3 seconds:  
\==> This increases to 38%.

\=> At 5 seconds:  
\==> The bounce rate dramatically reaches 73%.
