description: Explore how LLMs are accelerating the open-source movement in 2025,
  reshaping the software industry by making non-complex solutions freely
  available while preserving proprietary status for truly challenging problems.

LLMs aren't just accelerating open-source—they're reshaping what stays proprietary. The equation is simple: if it's not uniquely complex, it's going open.

What we're seeing:

• APIs becoming innovation hubs  
• Backend solutions going open  
• Basic functions being shared freely  
• Focus shifting to truly hard problems

The next two years will clearly separate what's genuinely complex (and stays proprietary) from what becomes community-driven. We're witnessing a fundamental shift in how we value and protect software.

What software do you think will remain proprietary in this new landscape?
