ChromeOS: Welcome to Estonia - 𝗔 𝗝𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗻𝗲𝘆 𝗶𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗹𝗱 𝗼𝗳 𝗢𝗽𝗲𝗻 𝗦𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗰𝗲

Over the past two years, I've been working on an open-source project called "ChromeOS: Welcome to Estonia." This software solution is designed for ChromeOS users who want to utilize Estonia's e-Residency ([e-Estonia](https://www.linkedin.com/company/e-estonia/)). The setup installs and configures the necessary tools to work with Estonia's digital identity, including the ability to sign and encrypt documents.

Estonia’s e-Residency program allows people worldwide to obtain a digital identity, enabling them to use Estonian government services and establish businesses within the EU. The goal was to simplify the process for ChromeOS users.

Like many software projects, this one faced challenges. A significant change in the e-Residency software caused my setup to stop functioning. In May, [Lauri Kaski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurikaski/), then CEO of [Cloudpoint](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cloudpoint-oy/), reached out to me:

\> "𝘍𝘪𝘳𝘴𝘵, 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘩𝘢𝘴 𝘣𝘦𝘦𝘯 𝘢 𝘨𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘵 𝘱𝘳𝘰𝘫𝘦𝘤𝘵 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘢𝘭𝘭 𝘊𝘩𝘳𝘰𝘮𝘦𝘖𝘚 𝘶𝘴𝘦𝘳𝘴. 𝘛𝘩𝘢𝘯𝘬𝘴 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘱𝘶𝘣𝘭𝘪𝘴𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘪𝘵. 𝘜𝘯𝘧𝘰𝘳𝘵𝘶𝘯𝘢𝘵𝘦𝘭𝘺, 𝘳𝘦𝘤𝘦𝘯𝘵 𝘪𝘯𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘴 𝘩𝘢𝘷𝘦 𝘧𝘢𝘪𝘭𝘦𝘥. 𝘈𝘳𝘦 𝘺𝘰𝘶 𝘢𝘣𝘭𝘦 𝘵𝘰 𝘩𝘦𝘭𝘱 𝘰𝘯 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘪𝘴𝘴𝘶𝘦 𝘦𝘢𝘴𝘪𝘭𝘺?"

I offered to resolve the issue more quickly for a fee, which he agreed to:

\> "𝘗𝘭𝘦𝘢𝘴𝘦 𝘱𝘳𝘰𝘤𝘦𝘦𝘥 𝘰𝘯 𝘧𝘪𝘹𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘪𝘵, 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘐 𝘢𝘮 𝘩𝘢𝘱𝘱𝘺 𝘵𝘰 𝘤𝘰𝘯𝘵𝘳𝘪𝘣𝘶𝘵𝘦 𝘵𝘰 𝘨𝘦𝘵𝘵𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘴𝘰𝘭𝘷𝘦𝘥. 𝘕𝘰𝘵 𝘭𝘰𝘰𝘬𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘪𝘵 𝘵𝘰 𝘨𝘦𝘵 𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘬𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘰𝘯 𝘮𝘺 𝘥𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘤𝘦 - 𝘣𝘶𝘵 𝘮𝘰𝘳𝘦 𝘰𝘯 𝘢𝘯 𝘰𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘢𝘭𝘭 𝘧𝘪𝘹 𝘵𝘰 𝘩𝘢𝘷𝘦 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘱𝘳𝘰𝘫𝘦𝘤𝘵 𝘶𝘱 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘳𝘶𝘯𝘯𝘪𝘯𝘨."

𝗦𝘂𝗽𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝘂𝗻𝗶𝘁𝘆

The support from Lauri and Cloudpoint made it possible for me to get the project back on track and even improve it. The setup is now fully automated.
