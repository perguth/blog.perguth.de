I always have too many tabs open. So I built myself a minimal start page that lives in tab one:

*   Quick links to all our environments (dev/staging/prod), color-coded so I don't accidentally push to the wrong one
    
*   Direct path to our Github project board and repos
    
*   Clean, valid HTML with a dash of CSS - nothing fancy
    

The nice part: When I need to add something, I just hit the edit link, update the source on Github, and it's live. No complexity, no maintenance overhead.

It's not revolutionary - just a small tool that removed some daily friction. But sometimes those are the best kind.

What small tools have you built that made your work a bit easier?
