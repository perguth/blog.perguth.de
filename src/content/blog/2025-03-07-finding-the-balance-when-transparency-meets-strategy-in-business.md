"𝗢𝗽𝗲𝗻 𝘀𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗰𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝗹𝗶𝗸𝗲 𝗮 𝗳𝗶𝗿𝘀𝘁 𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗲—𝗲𝘅𝗰𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴, 𝗿𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘀𝗼𝗺𝗲𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲𝘀 𝗮 𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘁𝗹𝗲 𝘁𝗼𝗼 𝗿𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴." ✨

Yesterday, I made the tough call to take our production code private. Why? Because publishing everything—including our issues—felt like airing our dirty laundry in Times Square. 🧺

At [sternvoll.com](http://sternvoll.com), we’re big on transparency. That’s why we share our analytics openly at [gdpr.sternvoll.com](http://gdpr.sternvoll.com) and even open-sourced our entire repo at [github.com/thingylabs/www.sternvoll.com](http://github.com/thingylabs/www.sternvoll.com). It was empowering, collaborative, and aligned with our values. 💻🌍

But here’s the lesson: 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆 𝗵𝗮𝘀 𝗶𝘁𝘀 𝗹𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘁𝘀. ⚖️

Sharing code and data builds trust and drives innovation, but it can also expose vulnerabilities—technical and strategic. Every issue, bug, and internal debate was out there for the world to see. As we grew, I realized some things are better kept in-house. 🤫

𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝘁𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗮𝘄𝗮𝘆𝘀 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘀:

• 𝗦𝗲𝘁 𝗯𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗮𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀. Transparency isn’t all-or-nothing. Decide what to share and what to protect. 🛑

• 𝗜𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗼𝗻 𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗻𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀. Like product development, your transparency strategy should evolve. 🔄

• 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘁𝗲𝗮𝗺. Public issues can feel like public criticism. Guard your team’s morale. 💪

Our code is now private, but our commitment to transparency remains. We’ll keep sharing what we can, learning as we go, and striving for that perfect balance between open and just open enough. 🌱

What’s your take? Have you ever dialed back transparency for strategic reasons? Let’s discuss! 🚀
