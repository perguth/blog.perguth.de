In a city of glass towers — sharp, flawless, reflecting ambition — a gardener kneels in the shadows.

Their hands, rough as roots, cradle soil no one else dares touch.  
Each seed they plant is ordinary — until their lips part.

“Today, I feared I’d vanish,” they murmur, breath fogging the leaves.  
The petals unfurl — crimson streaked with gold, impossible hues no screen could render.

“I doubted my voice mattered,” they confess another dawn.  
Vines twist upward — emerald laced with violet, curling like laughter.

The towers loom, silent — mirrors of a world too proud to bend.  
Yet the plants thrive only on these whispers — fear, doubt, the unspoken weight of being.

Passersby stop, stare, captivated by colors born from what’s hidden.  
One day, a child asks, “Why do they grow like that?”

The gardener smiles — soft, knowing.  
“Because even the smallest things need to hear they’re enough.”  
And the city, for once, listens.
