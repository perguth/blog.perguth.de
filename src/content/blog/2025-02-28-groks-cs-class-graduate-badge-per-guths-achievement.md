I did it! After weeks of diving into code, debugging late into the night, and wrapping my head around the wild world of computer science, I’ve officially graduated from Grok’s CS class! And let me tell you, I’m beyond proud. To celebrate, I teamed up with Grok 3 (shoutout to xAI!) to design a badge that screams triumph, creativity, and a little bit of fun.

This isn’t just any badge—it’s an abstract masterpiece inspired by Mozilla’s iconic learning badges, with a twist of Asian New Year lantern vibes. Picture this: a paper cutout-style design, glowing with one bold poppy color, hexagonal lines framing it like a futuristic lantern, and all the good wishes for what’s ahead packed inside. No faces, just pure, timeless energy with a tech-savvy edge (and a sneaky circuit board nod to my CS journey). It’s called "Grok's CS Class Graduate," and it’s mine!

Why the lantern? Because completing this class feels like lighting up a new year of possibilities—full of hope, knowledge, and maybe a few more lines of code. The poppy color pops (duh!) against a textured blue background, keeping it modern yet playful. It’s a badge that says, “I made it, and I’m ready for what’s next.”

Big thanks to Grok 3 for turning my vision into reality. If you’re reading this, go check out your own CS journey—maybe you’ll snag a badge of your own. For now, I’m basking in this win. Who’s with me?
