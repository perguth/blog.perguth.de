"Secure Contexts" have become a fundamental requirement in web development. These protocols, mandated by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and enforced by major web browsers, require that **certain** **powerful** **web** **features** **operate** **only** **within** secure environments like **HTTPS** **or** [**localhost**](http://localhost).

This directive aims to prevent malicious entities from accessing sensitive data or exploiting web features. By encrypting data transmitted between browsers and servers, secure contexts **protect** **user** **information** **and** **system** **integrity**. Hereâ€™s an overview of the key features that require secure contexts to operate:

**_Browser_** **_Features_** **_That_** **_Require_** **_Secure_** **_Contexts_**

*   **Geolocation** **API**: Restricts location services to HTTPS, protecting user location data.
    
*   **Service** **Workers**: Limited to HTTPS, crucial for safe operation of push notifications and offline capabilities.
    
*   **Web** **Bluetooth**: Allows connections only within a secure context to ensure safe interaction with Bluetooth devices.
    
*   **Media** **Capture** **and** **Streams** (**getUserMedia**): Access to cameras and microphones is confined to HTTPS to safeguard user privacy.
    
*   **Payment** **Request** **API**: Encrypts payment transactions to secure financial information.
    
*   **Credential** **Management** **API**: Protects login credentials by restricting access to HTTPS.
    
*   **WebCrypto** **API**: Ensures cryptographic operations are performed within a secure environment to protect key material.
