When it comes to the compensation of top-tier professionals in software development, the figures in the 90th percentile show how much companies are willing to pay for top talent at the senior level.

The 90th percentile indicates that 90% of the salaries in this group are below a certain amount, and only 10% are above it.

In other words, when we say that the 90th percentile for senior software developers in Germany is $139,000, it means that 90% of senior software developers in Germany earn a salary of up to $139,000, while the top 10% of developers have a salary that exceeds this amount.

What do you think of these figures? Germany ranks 7th - is that good or bad? How do you explain the outstanding salary situation in Switzerland?
